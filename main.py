import numpy as np


# Reading inputs
# 1) name of car
# 2) x pos, y pos, direction (only n, e, s, w)
# 3) enter commands for car
#   3a) eg. FFRFFFFRRL
#   This means car A will move forward twice, turn right, move forward four times, turn right twice, and turn left once.
# 4) print out current list of cars with name, position, direction, commands
#   4a) eg. - A, (1,2) N, FFRFFFFRRL
# 5) Give user choice to add 1 more car, or run simulation


# create field of w x h (width is column, height is row)

# Add car with name, position, direction
# make a class for car

# Run simulation
# 1) at each step, advance all cars by 1 command
# 2) if there is a collision, both cars collide at THAT square
